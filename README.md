# 2) MODEL DEPLOYMENT DEMONSTRATION

1. For this part, I have used the inference model at `https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/Zixtrauce/BaekBot` in the huggingface model hub: https://huggingface.co/models

2. Demonstration:

	a. Run the container with command `docker-compose up`.
	b. Go to Browser and open a web-page with `local-host:5000`, for me it was `127.0.0.1:5000`.
	c. Enter the text in the box and click on `send`.
	d. BaekBot will respond with an anwser.
	
3. I chose this model, because I wanted to use text as input as well as output, since I do not have frontend skills. Also, this model is interactive.

# 3) EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATION

- For this part I chose `imdb` dataset in the huggingface datasets hub: https://huggingface.co/datasets

- I had never done exploratory analysis before. I have made Deep Learning models, that is CNN, LSTM, neural network etc. That why I wanted to go with something easy and simple.
